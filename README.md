RPG game made in Python using OOP.

Some sprites and music were found in Google images, and later modified to better fit the game, links to creators are in "Credits.png".
We also got some help from various youtube tutorials, but most of it is coded from scratch. Game is not optimized, so some unnecessary code is included from earlier versions.
Everything is found in the same Python script.
